A confirmation email will be sent to your liberty email account to notify you when your TA is posted. If you make any changes to your course schedule, you must also update your enrollments on the GoArmyEd portal.

You can verify that your TA has been posted to your account by completing Financial Check-In. Financial Check-In is the final step in the enrollment process, and must be completed before you can start courses. Please review our Financial Check-In Guide for more information on this process.

We do not automatically receive this notice from the Department of Veterans Affairs. To accomplish this step, we recommend you submit a copy of your VONAPP confirmation page or Certificate of Eligibility (COE), or contact us directly to advise us of the benefit you will be using. Documentation is not required to set up your GI Bill with Liberty University, but it is encouraged to ensure the most accurate processing of your benefit and to give you access to special payment plan accommodations. 
The military payment plan is available through Financial Check-In for students using Chapter 30, 1606, or 1607 GI Bill benefits. Please note this option will not be made available until after a VA document verifying the chapter of benefit being used is received by the Office of Military Affairs or until after the Office of Military Affairs has verified your eligibility with the VA. This verification may not occur until after the Financial Check-In deadline.
Once you have filled out the VONAPP and let our office know you would like certifications, and you have enrolled in courses, the Office of Military Affairs will submit an enrollment certification (22-1999) to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. This process typically takes 3-5 business days, but may take longer during peak enrollment periods. Once your courses have been certified, you will receive an email to your Liberty email account indicating the courses and dates that were reported to the VA.  On average it will take 6 weeks for the VA to process your certifications.
Please be advised, you may submit the VONAPP confirmation page instead of the COE. However, after your first semester of enrollment, our office will require the COE.

The effective date on the PACCT contract will be the first day your classes start. The PACCT form and an overview of the steps required for setting up the GI Bill with our office are available here: http://www.liberty.edu/index.cfm?PID=18783 
Once our office has both documents on file our office will be able to post credit and certify your classes accordingly with the VA. You can email these documents to vabenefits@liberty.edu or fax them to (434) 455-1287. 
Please be advised, you may submit the VONAPP confirmation page instead of the COE. However, after your first semester of enrollment, our office will require the COE in order to continue posting an advanced credit to your account.
</div></li><li class='titles pitem'>VA33 Turn Around<div class='item'>Once you have registered for courses, it takes our office 3-5 business days to post advanced credit to your account and submit your enrollment to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Since you registered for courses on ____ our office will post credit and submit your enrollment by _____. Our office will email you once this has been done. </div></li><li class='titles pitem'>VA 35<div class='item'>Once you fill out the VONAPP 22-5490/22-5495 and submit it to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, you will need to notify Liberty's Office of Military Affairs that you will be using your GI Bill benefits for your enrollment. We do not automatically receive this notice from the Department of Veterans Affairs. To accomplish this step, we recommend you submit your VONAPP confirmation page or Certificate of Eligibility (COE), or contact us directly to advise us of the benefit you will be using. Documentation is not required to set up your GI Bill with Liberty University, but it is encouraged to ensure the most accurate processing of your benefit and to give you access to special payment plan accommodations
The military payment plan is available through Financial Check-In for students using Chapter 35 GI Bill benefits. Please note this option will not be made available until after a VA document verifying the chapter of benefit being used is received by the Office of Military Affairs or until after the Office of Military Affairs has verified your eligibility with the VA. This verification may not occur until after the Financial Check-In deadline.
Please be advised, you may submit the VONAPP confirmation page instead of the COE. However, after your first semester of enrollment, our office will require the COE. You can email these documents to vabenefits@liberty.edu or fax them to (434) 455-1287.

</div></li><li class='titles pitem'>Verification Documents Needed<div class='item'>In order to award the military benefits that Liberty University offers, our office will need a military verification document such as an LES, military orders, or a DD-214 showing an honorable or general character of service. We will also need a government issued photo ID such as a driver's license. We cannot accept military ID's/ or a drivers license that has been expired for more than one year. These documents can be emailed to luomilitary@liberty.edu or faxed to (434) 455-1287. Please visit our

</div></li><li class='titles pitem'>Verification Documents Needed Due to Policy Change<div class='item'>In reviewing your account I see that you were approved for military benefits while pursuing your previous degree program. However, each time a new application is place our office must approve students for the Liberty given benefits again according to the current military verification policy. At this time we do also require a copy of a government issued photo ID such as a drivers license or passport. Please be advised that per government policy we cannot accept a military ID. These documents can be emailed to luomilitary@liberty.edu or faxed to (434) 455-1287. </div></li><li class='titles pitem'>Verification Documents Needed- Spouse<div class='item'>In order to award the military benefits that Liberty University offers, our office will need a military verification document such as an LES, military orders, or a DD-214 showing an honorable or general character of service.

</div></li><li class='titles pitem'>VONAPP Confirmation Page<div class='item'>We are aware that the VONAPP website is currently not allowing students to print a copy of the VONAPP form. Therefore, we can temporarily accept the confirmation page that shows you completed a VONAPP form for the VA. 

If you send the confirmation page for your first semester our office will require a Certificate of Eligibility after your first semester of enrollment. The VA should mail you a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility or the Award letter each semester that you use your GI Bill. Our institution does not receive a copy of this letter. Therefore, we will require a copy of this letter after your first semester of enrollment. This letter would include information such as your remaining months of eligibility. 
</div></li><li class='titles pitem'>WAVE<div class='item'>After your certifications have been processed by the VA, you will need to verify your enrollment on a monthly basis in WAVE.  You will not be able to verify your enrollment on WAVE until the VA processes your enrollment certification, which usually takes 6-8 weeks from the time our office submits your enrollment to the VA.  You can verify your enrollment through www.gibill.va.gov, or call 877-823-2378. </div></li><li class='titles pitem'>Why Overpayment<div class='item'>Typically, a change in enrollment is the most frequent reason for being sent into overpayment/debt management status. Other causes are often switching your GI Bill&reg; without notifying the school prior to certification, or a processing error. If you have specific questions as to why you were sent into overpayment, including specific amounts, please contact the VA at (888) 442-4551.</div></li></ul></li><li class='titles'>Admissions Verification <ul><li class='titles pitem'>accessing file<div class='item'>One moment please while I access the student's file. </div></li><li class='titles pitem'>Manual Reg<div class='item'>Have you submitted a manual registration yet? </div></li><li class='titles pitem'>Extenuating Circumstance<div class='item'>Are there extenuating circumstances that would make this a rush situation? </div></li><li class='titles pitem'>ID<div class='item'>What is the student's ID number? </div></li><li class='titles pitem'>Hello!<div class='item'>Hello, my name is $!{operator.displayname}.
