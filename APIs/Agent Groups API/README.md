# Python - Agent Groups API Sample
This is a basic example of how to connect to the Agent Groups API in Python by using the requests_oauthlib. The example shows how you can get all of the agent groups that are on your account, and how to get more information for a single agent group by using its id. In order to run this example you will need to update the AgentGroupsAPI_Sample.py file with your Agent Groups API credentials.
