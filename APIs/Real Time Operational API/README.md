# Python - Real Time Operational API To CSV Pandas Example
This is an example of how to connect to the Real Time Operational API in Python by using the requests_oauthlib, and how to create a CSV file with the data that is returned from the API by using Pandas. In order to run this example you will need to update the rt-api-to_csv-pandas.py file with your Engagement History API credentials.
