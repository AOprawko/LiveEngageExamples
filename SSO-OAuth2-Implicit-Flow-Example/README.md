# SSO OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow Example

This is an example of how to implement the SSO OAuth 2.0 implicit Flow in NodeJS. It uses the jsonwebtoken module to generate and sign the OpenID Connect Token. 

The example does not verify if the user is logged in, and should not be implemented as is. It is only meant to show how to generate the Token.

You can see a live example of the NodeJS app here: https://enigmatic-shelf-93460.herokuapp.com/
